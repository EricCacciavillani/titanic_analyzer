# TITANIC ANALYZER 

In this project we are going to use data structures and algorithms to find out some truth behind Titanic's tragic case. After the famous ship sunk people have gathered some information from witnesses about what happened on those last minutes. The Titanic movie shows some details about who got into boats and how different people reacted to saving their life vs helping others in a sinking ship. Some sources even suggested that richer people who had higher-class tickets had better chance of survival. However, witness stories sometimes can be biased, so we are going to use factual data to find out for ourselves who got saved and if there were any factors that went into that like ticket class or age.


## Building & Running
Open your terminal/Command-Line and follow the instructions below:
#### &emsp;&emsp; 1. Move your current working directory to (titanic_analyzer/src)
#### &emsp;&emsp; 2. To build the project on your machine: ` make `
#### &emsp;&emsp; 3. To run the program: ` .\titanic_analyzer `
#### Additionally, you could type in this command to remove any files from the previous build of the program: ` make clean `


## Dataset
For this project you will be using a real dataset that was gathered on titanic and contains information on every passenger on the ship. The dataset includes their ticket class, age, sex and whether or not they survived (see ` titanic.csv `).



## Data Structures and Algorithms
